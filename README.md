# Userchrome Toggle
<img align="right" src="https://github.com/Joolee/userchrome-toggle/raw/main/images/icon.svg" width="175">

The userchrome.css file lets you customize the Firefox interface deeply, but it's not very interactive by default.
This [Firefox extension](https://addons.mozilla.org/firefox/addon/userchrome-toggle/) adds a new button to your toolbar that allows you to toggle custom userchrome.css styling on-the fly by changing the window title. Using invisible UTF-8 characters by default, you won't even notice a thing. Toggle a single style or select up to three styles to toggle in a drop-down menu. Hardcore keyboard users can even use customizable keyboard-shortcuts.
